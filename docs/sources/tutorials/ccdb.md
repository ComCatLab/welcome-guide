# Creating a CCDB Account (WIP)

You should receive an email invitation.

Once you have set up your account, set up multi-factor authentication,
create an SSH key on the computer from which you will log into DRA clusters,
and **attempt** to log in. **Your first login will likely fail, but it is
important that you try as soon as possible to initiate the process of account
creation.**
